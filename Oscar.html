<cite> THE wild bee reels from bough to bough
With his furry coat and his gauzy wing.
Now in a lily-cup, and now
Setting a jacinth bell a-swing, </cite>
<br>  
<P3> The poem that are going to be displayed are from the mind of Oscar Wilde he has a fantaastic way of portraying his work to the reader so that they can be enthusiastic about reading the great work that is supported by him. How does he give this, well he has studied in Trinity college, just a simple place for work. Please understand that he had difficulty being with a women as he was to sure about producing work in that state of mind, her name was may be in the poem.  Was it due to a religous imagery back home that focus such a creative mind to be seen by many people unknown. Well, thats how we have to realise if her was also work for her or so to be given. But its said that she is gone. </p3>
