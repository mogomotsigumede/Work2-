<h1> Explosion By the Factory </h1> 
<hr>
<h3 style="color:steelblue;"> Food not for sell</h3>
<p1> An unknown location that has brought fear into the hearts of the ccommunity which was at the bakery food won't be sold in order to make some poeple happy in the heavy populated road. </p1><br>
<p1> How are you suppose to deal with something like this well it comes to a strong point where there was a panic of flames going off at the store that the bakery was not opperating due to the late hours of it not opening </p2> <br> 
<p2> What a shame on the community to lost something that hasn't nessecarily brought clean food to the people ceilings where covered in greese and dirt the place had nothing to show that it was improving based on the people love for creamy doughnuts. That place was covered in flames and was in ash. Park Street has no longer jo. </p2>
<p2> The Army was spotted dealing with the incident but it was after it had to be scrapped and made into Endgame. </p2>
<br><p2> Please provide some of your feed back in order to let the factory know what it is that has too be done to the company over come this. The first help was there to help what was going on in order to justify the need to do something about the destoried place. But it is the company that must be incharge.  </p2>
